# this program is a prototype of a smart home monitoring system that I planned and developed while working under Dr. Anwar Haque at the Undergraduate Student Research Internship 

# the goal of this project was to create a program that would monitor the usage of smart appliances in a home, schedule recurring tasks (such as turning on the dishwasher) during off-peak energy hours, project monthly energy bills based on current usage patterns, and inform the user when an appliance is running outside of it's scheduled time while simultaneously providing an updated energy bill projection based on any activity outside the predetermined "optimal schedule"

# the user is asked to select their appliances from a menu, then they are provided with an ideal schedule and projected monthly energy bill assuming this schedule is followed. They can then edit the schedule and will receive an updated energy bill projection according to their edit
